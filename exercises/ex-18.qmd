## Genomewide chromatin analysis with metaplots and heatmaps

Last class we saw what the different methods to profile chromatin
accessibility can tell us about general chromatin structure and possible regulation
at specific regions in a small portion of a chromosome.

We also want to make sure these conclusions are valid throughout the genome.
Since we want to keep the file sizes small, we will ask if they are valid across
an entire chromosome.

### Load libraries

First we will plot the profiles of all our data sets relative to the
transcription start site (TSS), where all the action seems to be happening:

```{r}
#| label: load-libs
#| message: false
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(cowplot)

# `glue` is a handy library for plot annotations
library(glue)

library(valr)
library(ComplexHeatmap)
```

### Load data

First, we need to load relevant files:

-   `yeast_tss_chrII.bed.gz` contains transcription start sites (TSS) for genes on yeast chromosome 2.
-   `sacCer3.chrom.sizes` contains the sizes of all yeast chromosomes, needed for some of the calculations we'll do. We'll grab this from the UCSC download site.

```{r, tidy=FALSE}
#| label: load-data
#| eval: false
yeast_tss <- read_???(
  here("data/block-dna/yeast_tss_chrII.bed.gz")
)

genome <- read_???("https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/sacCer3/bigZips/sacCer3.chrom.sizes")
```

### Load signals

Next we'll load bigWigs for the ATAC and MNase experiments, containing either short or long fragments.

Recall that the information encoded in short and long fragments should be reflected in our interpretations.

```{r, tidy=FALSE}
#| label: load-bigwigs
#| eval: false
acc_tbl <-
  tibble(
    file_name = c(
      "yeast_mnase_lt50.bw",
      "yeast_mnase_134_160.bw",
      "yeast_atac_lt120.bw",
      "yeast_atac_gt120.bw"
    ),
    sample_type = c(
      "MNase_Short", "MNase_Long",
      "ATAC_Short", "ATAC_Long"
    )
  ) |>
  mutate(
    file_path = here("data/block-dna", file_name),
    big_wig = purrr::___(
      file_path, ~ read_bigwig(.x)
    )
  ) |>
  select(sample_type, big_wig)
```

# Meta-plots

## Setting up regions for a meta-plot

Next, we need to set up some windows for analyzing signal relative to each TSS.
This is an important step that will ultimately impact our interpretations.

In genomic meta-plots, you first decide on a window size relevant to the
features you are measuring, and then make "windows" around a reference point,
spanning some distance both up- and downstream. If the features involve gene
features, we also need to take strand into account.

Reference points could be:

- transcription start or end sites
- boundaries of exons and introns
- enhancers
- centromeres and telomeres

The window size should be relevant the reference points, such that small- or
large-scale features are emphasized in the plot. Moreover, the window typically
spans some distance both up- and downstream of the reference points.

Once the window size has been decided, the next step is to make "sub-windows"
around a reference point. If gene features are involved, we also need to take
strand into account.

(The state of genome annotation directly influences the quality of the meta-plot
or heatmap.)

For small features like transcription factor binding sites (8-20 bp), you might
set up smaller windows (maybe 1 bp) at a distance \~20 bp up- and downstream of
a reference point.

For larger features like nucleosome positions or chromatin domains, you might
set up larger windows (\~200 bp) at distances up to \~10 kbp up- and downstream
of a set of reference points.

## Metaplot workflow

![Metaplot workflow overview](../img/block-dna/metaplot-workflow.png)

## Chromatin accessibility around transcription start sites (TSSs)

```{r, tidy=FALSE}
#| label: create-tss-coords
#| eval: false
region_size_total <- 1500
region_size_half <- region_size_total / 2
win_size <- 10

# need a function that generates a sequence of numbers
win_coords <- ___(
  -region_size_half,
  region_size_half,
  win_size
)
```

Next, we'll use two valr functions to expand the window of the reference
point (`bed_slop()`) and then break those windows into evenly spaced intervals 
(`bed_makewindows()`).

```{r}
#| label: tss-slop-mw
#| eval: false
yeast_tss |>
  bed_???(genome, both = region_size_half) |>
  bed_???(win_size = win_size)
```

At this point, we also address the fact that the TSS data are stranded. Can someone describe what the issue is here, based on the figure above?

```{r}
#| label: create-tss-windows
tss_win_tbl <-
  yeast_tss |>
  bed_slop(genome, both = region_size_half) |>
  bed_makewindows(win_size = win_size) |>
  mutate(
    win_coord = case_when(
      strand == "-" ~ rev(win_coords),
      .default = win_coords
    ),
    .by = name
  ) |>
  select(-.win_id, -score, -strand)
```

This next step uses valr `bed_map()`, to calculate the total signal for each
window by intersecting signals from the bigWig files.

```{r}
#| label: map-signals
acc_tbl <-
  acc_tbl |>
  mutate(
    tss_win_sum = purrr::map(
      big_wig,
      ~ bed_map(
        tss_win_tbl,
        .x,
        win_signal = sum(score)
      )
    )
  )
```

Once we have the values from `bed_map()`, we can group by `win_coord` and
calculate a summary statistic for each window.

Remember that `win_coord` is the same relative position for each TSS, so these
numbers represent a composite signal a the same position across all TSS.

```{r}
#| label: calc-win-stats
tss_meta_tbl <-
  select(acc_tbl, sample_type, tss_win_sum) |>
  unnest(cols = c(tss_win_sum)) |>
  summarize(
    win_mean = mean(win_signal, na.rm = TRUE),
    win_sd = sd(win_signal, na.rm = TRUE),
    .by = c(win_coord, sample_type)
  ) |>
  replace_na(list(win_mean = 0, win_sd = 0))
```

## Meta-plot of signals around TSSs

Finally, let's plot the data relative to TSS for each of the windows.

```{r}
#| label: plot-meta-signals
n_tss <- length(unique(yeast_tss$name))

ggplot(
  tss_meta_tbl,
  aes(
    x = win_coord,
    y = win_mean
  )
) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1, color = "red") +
  facet_wrap(
    ~sample_type,
    nrow = 2,
    scales = "free_y"
  ) +
  theme_minimal_grid() +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(
      angle = 45,
      vjust = 1,
      hjust = 1
    )
  ) +
  labs(
    x = "Position relative to TSS (bp)",
    y = "Signal (mean of window sums)",
    title = "Chromatin accessibility around transcription start sites",
    subtitle = glue("{n_tss} features on S. cerevisiae chrII")
  )
```

## Interpreting the meta-plots 

- What is the direction of transcription in these meta-plots?

- What are the features of chromatin near TSS measured by these different experimental conditions?

- How do you interpret the increased signal of the +1 nucleosome in the "MNase_Long" condition, relative to e.g. -1, +2, +3, etc.?

- What are the differences in ATAC and MNase treatments that lead to these distinctive patterns?

# Heatmaps

## Heatmap of signals around TSSs

To generate a heatmap, we need to reformat our data slightly.

Take a look at `acc_tbl` and think about how you might reorganize the following way:

- rows contain the data for individual loci (i.e., each TSS)
- columns are ordered positions relative to the TSS (i.e., most upstream to most downstream)

We're going to plot a heatmap of the "MNase_Long" data. There are two ways
to get these data.

```{r}
#| label: heatmap-data-base
#| eval: false
mnase_tbl <- acc_tbl[acc_tbl$sample_type == "MNase_Short", ]$tss_win_sum[[1]]
```

Or, using dplyr / tidyr:

```{r}
#| label: heatmap-data-tidy
mnase_tbl <-
  filter(
    acc_tbl,
    sample_type == "MNase_Long"
  ) |>
    select(-big_wig) |>
    unnest(cols = c(tss_win_sum))
```

Either way, now we need to reformat the data.

```{r, tidy=FALSE}
#| label: pivot-heatmap-tbl
#| eval: false
mnase_tbl_wide <-
  mnase_tbl |>
  select(
    name,
    win_coord,
    win_signal
  ) |>
  # this step is important to sort + and - windows correctly
  arrange(name, win_coord) |>
  replace_na(
    list(win_signal = 0)
  ) |>
  pivot_???(
    id_cols = name,
    names_from = "win_coord",
    values_from = "win_signal"
  )
```

Once we have the data reformatted, we just convert to a matrix and feed it to
`ComplexHeatmap::Heatmap()`.

```{r, tidy=FALSE}
#| label: heatmap-matrix-plot
#| eval: false
# drop the name & convert to matrix
mnase_mtx <-
  select(mnase_tbl_wide, -name) |>
  as.___()

ComplexHeatmap::___(
  mnase_mtx,
  cluster_columns = FALSE,
  show_row_dend = FALSE,
  show_column_names = FALSE,
  show_heatmap_legend = FALSE
)
```

## Interpreting meta-plots and heatmaps

It's worth considering what meta-plots and heatmaps *can* and *can't* tell you.

1.  What are the similarities and differences between heatmaps and meta-plots?

2.  What types of conclusions can you draw from each type of plot?

3.  What are some features of MNase-seq and ATAC-seq that become more clear when
looking across many loci at the same time?

4.  What are some hypotheses you can generate based on these plots?

## Assessing the signfiicance of observed patterns.

One approach for assessing the signifcance of a pattern (e.g., the density
of nucleosomes around transcription start sites), is to randomize the reference
points, and use those to remeasure density. This can be done by generating
a random set of TSS like:

``` r
n_tss <- length(unique(yeast_tss$name))
bed_random(genome, length = 1, n = n_tss)
```

Given enough random sites, you will be able to vizulaized what a null distribution of overlaps looks like. If you reframe your question around a response variable (i.e., "how many intact nucleosomes are within 500 bp of a TSS?") then you can calcuate an empirical p-value using the approaches covered in the bootcamp.

## Utility of metaplots and heatmaps in practice

There are a few specific cases when you should consider using the metaplot /
heatmap strategy.

If you have data from two different conditions (i.e., plus/minus a transcription
factor that might change the state of multiple promoters), you could make a
metaplot for each of the plus and minus conditions, to see of common patterns
manifest. You might also create a heatmap of the conditions, which might reveal
smaller groups of affected genes that would be masked by the metaplot
aggregation.

The approaches are also useful to compare patterns across types of reference points.
For example, you might examine chromatin marks (measured by CUT&TAG) relative to
the following: transcription starts, exon starts, exon ends, transcription ends.
