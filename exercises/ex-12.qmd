## Two changes {.smaller}

1.  We are going to use `ggpubr` rather than `ggplot2` - Don't tell Jay ;)

-   It has great visualization for the stats on the plots.
-   Different syntax!!
    -   **must use double quotes around "variable names"**

2.  Due to reviewer #3, we will pivot to a more "physiologically relevant" data set `biochem` that consists of mouse measurements.

. . .

## Prepare mouse biochem data {.smaller}

```{r}
#| echo: true

# we are reading the data directly from the internet
biochem <- read_tsv("http://mtweb.cs.ucl.ac.uk/HSMICE/PHENOTYPES/Biochemistry.txt", show_col_types = FALSE) |>
  janitor::clean_names()

# simplify names a bit more
colnames(biochem) <- gsub(pattern = "biochem_", replacement = "", colnames(biochem))

# we are going to simplify this a bit and only keep some columns
keep <- colnames(biochem)[c(1,6,9,14,15,24:28)]
biochem <- biochem[,keep]

# get weights for each individual mouse
# careful: did not come with column names
weight <- read_tsv("http://mtweb.cs.ucl.ac.uk/HSMICE/PHENOTYPES/weight", col_names = F, show_col_types = FALSE)

# add column names
colnames(weight) <- c("subject_name","weight")

# add weight to biochem table and get rid of NAs
# rename gender to sex
b <- inner_join(biochem, weight, by="subject_name") |> 
  na.omit() |>
  rename(sex=gender)
```

## Compare mean of a variable to a known value {.smaller}

$y$ is independent of $x$

$y$ is continuous

$x$ is constant

**Parametric: One-sample t-test**

`t_test(y ~ 1, mu = x)`

**Nonparametric: Wilcoxon signed-rank**

`wilcox_test(y ~ 1, mu = x)`

1.  Examine and specify the variable(s)
2.  Declare null hypothesis $\mathcal{H}_0$
3.  Calculate test-statistic, exact p-value

Think did the expression of my gene change...

## 1. Examine and specify the variable(s) {.smaller}

Let's explore mouse $weight$

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
#| eval: false

ggdensity(
  data = b,
  x = "??",
  add = "mean",
  rug = TRUE
  )

```

. . .

let's see some summary stats

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
#| eval: false

b |> 
  get_summary_stats(
    ??,
    type = "common",
    show = c("mean","median","sd")
    )

```

## Is it normally distributed?

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
#| eval: false


ggqqplot(
  data = b,
  x = "??"
  )

```

Looks reasonable

. . .

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
#| eval: false


b |> 
  ??_test(weight)
```

Yikes!

No easy answers...gotta make a call. We'll try both.

## 2. Declare null hypothesis $\mathcal{H}_0$

Since this is a one-way test, we don't need to worry if the groups have equal variance (only 1 group). But, we need a standard to compare against. I asked google, `how much does a mouse weigh in grams?`

Answer: 20-35 g, I'm going with $27.5 g$ as our standard.

> $\mathcal{H}_0$ is that the mean of mouse $weight$ can be explained by $27.5$

$weight$ is the *response variable*

$27.5$ is the *explanatory variable*

## 3. Calculate test-statistic, exact p-value {.smaller}

Nonparametric test:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
#| eval: false

x <- 27.5 # standard from google

b |>
  ??_test(weight ~ 1, mu = ??) |>
  gt()


```

. . .

Parametric test:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
#| eval: false

x <- 27.5 # standard from google

b |>
  ??_test(weight ~ 1, mu = ??) |>
  gt()


```

. . .

P values are well below 0.05

> $\mathcal{H}_0$ is that the mean of mouse $weight$ can be explained by $27.5$ is **NOT WELL SUPPORTED**

So $27.5 g$ not able to describe weight

Not surprising since our mean mouse weight is `r round(mean(b$weight),1)`. Don't believe everything you read on the internet.

## Compare mean of two groups {.smaller}

$y$ is independent of $x$

$y$ is continuous

$x$ is categorical with 2 groups (factor w/2 levels)

**Parametric: Student's t-test**

`t_test(y ~ x)` [more here](https://rpkgs.datanovia.com/rstatix/reference/t_test.html)

need to pay attention to: `var.equal` `paired`

**Nonparametric: Wilcoxon signed-rank**

`wilcox_test(y ~ x)` [more here](https://rpkgs.datanovia.com/rstatix/reference/wilcox_test.html)

need to pay attention to: `paired`

1.  Examine and specify the variable(s)
2.  Declare null hypothesis $\mathcal{H}_0$
3.  Calculate test-statistic, exact p-value

## Tangent on Student's t-test

The T-Distribution, also known as Student's t-distribution, gets its name from William Sealy Gosset who first published it in English in 1908 in the scientific journal Biometrika using his pseudonym "Student" because his employer preferred staff to use pen names when publishing scientific papers instead of their real name, so he used the name "Student" to hide his identity.

##  1. Examine and specify the variable(s) {.smaller}

We will compare mouse $weight$ by $sex$.


$weight$ is the *response variable*

$sex$ is the *explanatory variable*

$y$ ~ $x$

$weight$ ~ $sex$

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
#| eval: false


ggdensity(
  data = b,
  color = "sex",
  x = "weight",
  add = "mean",
  rug = TRUE
  )

```

---

I want the response variable on the $y$ axis and the explanatory variable on the $x$ axis.

Violin plot

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
#| eval: false
ggviolin(
  data = b,
  y = "??",
  x = "??",
  fill = "??",
  add = "mean_sd"
  )

```

. . .

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
#| eval: false


b |> 
  group_by(??) |>
  get_summary_stats(
    ??,
    type = "common",
    show = c("mean","median","sd")
    )

```

## Is it normally distributed? {.smaller}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
#| eval: false
ggqqplot(
  data = b,
  x = "??",
  color = "??"
  )

```


. . .

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
#| eval: false
b |> 
  group_by(sex) |>
  ??_test(weight) |>
  gt()

```

Looks reasonable

## Equal variance?

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
#| eval: false
b |> 
  ??_test(weight~sex) |>
  gt()

```

OK - so we can use t-test, but variance is not equal.

## 2. Declare null hypothesis $\mathcal{H}_0$


> $\mathcal{H}_0$ is that $sex$ cannot explain $weight$


## 3. Calculate test-statistic, exact p-value {.smaller}

Nonparametric test:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
#| eval: false
b |>
  ??_test(?? ~ ??, ref.group = "F") |>
  gt()


```

. . .

Parametric test:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
#| eval: false

x <- 27.5 # standard from google

b |>
  ??_test(weight ~ sex,
         var.equal = ??,
         ref.group = "F") |>
  gt()


```

. . .

P values are well below 0.05

> $\mathcal{H}_0$ is that $sex$ cannot explain $weight$ is **NOT WELL SUPPORTED**

$sex$ can explain $weight$

## Visualize the result {.smaller}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: slide
#| eval: false


# save statistical test result
statres <- b |>
  t_test(weight ~ sex,
         var.equal = F, 
         ref.group = "F")


ggviolin(
  data = b,
  y = "weight",
  x = "sex",
  fill = "sex",
  add = "mean_sd"
  ) +
  stat_pvalue_manual(
    ??,
    label = "p",
    y.position = 34 
    ) +
  ylim(10,35)


```


## Compare means of three or more groups {.smaller}


$y$ is independent of $x$

$y$ is continuous

$x$ is 2 or more groups of categorical data

**Parametric: ANOVA**

`anova_test(y ~ group)` [more info](https://rpkgs.datanovia.com/rstatix/reference/anova_test.html)

**Nonparametric: Kruskal-Wallis test**

`kruskal_test(y ~ group)` [more info](https://rpkgs.datanovia.com/rstatix/reference/kruskal_test.html)

1.  Examine and specify the variable(s)
2.  Declare null hypothesis $\mathcal{H}_0$
3.  Calculate test-statistic, exact p-value



## 1. Examine and specify the variable(s) {.smaller}

We will compare mouse $weight$ by $family$.


$weight$ is the *response variable*

$family$ is the *explanatory variable*

$y$ ~ $x$

$weight$ ~ $family$

```{r prep fam data}
#| echo: true

# i have pre-selected some families to compare
myfams <- c("B1.5:E1.4(4) B1.5:A1.4(5)",
            "F1.3:A1.2(3) F1.3:E2.2(3)",
            "A1.3:D1.2(3) A1.3:H1.2(3)",
            "D5.4:G2.3(4) D5.4:C4.3(4)")

# only keep the familys in myfams
bfam <- b |>
  filter(family %in% myfams) |>
  droplevels() 

# simplify family names and make factor
bfam$family <- gsub(pattern = "\\..*", replacement = "", x = bfam$family) |>
  as.factor()


# make B1 the reference (most similar to overall mean)
bfam$family <- relevel(x = bfam$family, ref ="B1")

```


## Visualize the variable(s) {.smaller}

I want the response variable on the $y$ axis and the explanatory variable on the $x$ axis.

Boxplot

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
#| eval: false


ggboxplot(
  data = bfam,
  y = "??",
  x = "??",
  fill = "??"
  )

```

. . .

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
#| eval: false


bfam |> 
  group_by(??) |>
  get_summary_stats(
    ??,
    type = "common",
    show = c("mean","median","sd")
    )

```

## Is it normally distributed? {.smaller}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
#| eval: false
ggqqplot(
  data = bfam,
  x = "weight",
  color = "??"
  )

```


. . .

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
#| eval: false
bfam |> 
  group_by(family) |>
  ??_test(weight) |>
  gt()

```

Looks reasonable

## Equal variance?

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
#| eval: false
bfam |> 
  ??_test(??~??) |>
  gt()

```

OK - so we can use anova!

## 2. Declare null hypothesis $\mathcal{H}_0$


> $\mathcal{H}_0$ is that $family$ cannot explain $weight$


## 3. Calculate test-statistic, exact p-value {.smaller}

Parametric test:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
#| eval: false

bfam |>
  ??_test(weight ~ ??) |>
  gt()


```

. . . 

Nonparametric test:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
#| eval: false
bfam |>
  ??_test(weight ~ family) |>
  gt()



```


. . .

P values are well below 0.05

> $\mathcal{H}_0$ is that $family$ cannot explain $weight$ is **NOT WELL SUPPORTED**

$family$ can explain $weight$

## Visualize the result {.smaller}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: slide

# save statistical test result
statres <- bfam |>
  anova_test(weight ~ sex)


ggboxplot(
  data = bfam,
  y = "weight",
  x = "family",
  fill = "family"
  ) + 
  stat_anova_test()
  

```


## Multiple pairwise comparisons  {.smaller}

Quick aside

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: slide
#| eval: false
# save statistical test result
pairwise <- bfam |>
  t_test(weight ~ family, ref.group = "??") 


ggboxplot(bfam,
          x = "family",
          y = "weight",
          fill = "weight",
          ) +
  stat_pvalue_manual(
    pairwise,
    label = "p.adj", 
    y.position = c(30, 32, 34)
    ) +
  ylim(10,38)


```

Notice that not all pairwise differences are significant, yet the ANOVA is significant.
