## Chromatin accessbility patterns and genome function

This class we'll examine chormatin accessibility patterns and begin to get a sense of what they mean,
both at the fine-scale (single base-pair) and genomewide.

## Load the libraries 

These are libraries we've used before. patchwork is a library for composing groups of plots.

```{r}
#| label: load-libs
#| message: false
library(tidyverse)
library(cowplot)
library(here)
library(patchwork)
```

These are new libraries specifically for genome analysis. You learned about valr and Gviz for your homework.

rtracklayer provides a few utility functions we'll use today, and TxDb.Scerevisiae.UCSC.sacCer3.sgdGene provides
gene annotations for the S. cerevisiae genome.

```{r}
#| label: genome-libs
#| message: false
library(valr)
library(Gviz)

library(rtracklayer)
library(TxDb.Scerevisiae.UCSC.sacCer3.sgdGene)
```

## Load the data

In this and the next class we will analyze ATAC-seq and MNase-seq data sets from budding yeast. Here are the references for the two data set:

#### ATAC-seq

> Schep AN, Buenrostro JD, Denny SK, Schwartz K, Sherlock G, Greenleaf WJ. Structured nucleosome fingerprints enable high-resolution mapping of chromatin architecture within regulatory regions. Genome Res. 2015 PMID: 26314830; PMCID: PMC4617971. [[Link]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4617971/) [[Data]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE66386)

#### MNase-seq

### Experimental consideration 

In a standard MNase-seq experiment, DNA around ~150 bp is extracted to look closely at nucleosome occupancy & positioning. However, the above study *did not* perform size selection. This is important as now we can look at both transcription factor binding sites and nucleosome positions.

## Fragment size distributions are informative

First, we will determine the fragment size distributions obtained from the two experiments. These sizes are the fingerprints of particles that were protecting nuclear DNA from digestion.

I have performed the alignment of paired-end reads and converted all reads into a bed file where each line of the bed file denotes a single fragment from start to end.

First, load the ATAC-seq reads:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column
atac_tbl <- read_bed(
  here("data/block-dna/yeast_atac_chrII.bed.gz"),
)
atac_tbl
```

Next, load the MNase reads.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column
mnase_tbl <- read_bed(
  here("data/block-dna/yeast_mnase_chrII.bed.gz")
)
mnase_tbl
```

Working with a small genome is a huge advantage -- we can study the whole chromosome in this class. For *Drosophila* and human data we dealt with before, we were looking at a subsection of the chromosome.

## Expectations for chromatin fragment lengths

Let's remind ourselves of the expectations for chromatin fragment lengths from MNase-seq and ATAC-seq experiments.

### MNase-seq

### ATAC-seq

![](../img/block-dna/atac-explain.png)

## Length distributions of chromatin-derived DNA fragments

For the MNase-seq BED file, you see that there are only three columns: `chrom`, `start`, and `end`. Calculating fragment length is very simple:

```{r}
#| echo: true
mutate(mnase_tbl, frag_len = end - start)
```

Let's use this approach to examine the fragment length distribution.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
#| output-location: column
acc_tbl <-
  bind_rows(
    mutate(mnase_tbl, type = "mnase"),
    mutate(atac_tbl, type = "atac")
  )

ggplot(
  acc_tbl,
  aes(x = end - start)
) +
  geom_histogram(
    # single base-pair resolution
    binwidth = 1
  ) +
  facet_grid(
    rows = vars(type),
    scales = "free_y"
  ) +
  xlim(30, 500) +
  labs(
    x = "fragment length (bp)",
    title = "Histogram of fragment lengths from\naccessibility measurements"
  ) +
  theme_cowplot()
```

### Interpreations

1.  How would you describe the two distributions? Are they similar?

2.  Can you make any biological conclusions based on the length distributions?

## Periodicity in the fragment lengths

The ATAC data seems to be periodic. How can we test that hypothesis? We can calculate the autocorrelation of the length distribution. Can someone explain what [autocorrelation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocorrelation) means?

We'll use the base `hist` function to calculate the densities of the above histogram. Let's write a function we can use to analyze fragment lengths.

```{r}
#| label: fun-fragment-len
#| echo: true
fragment_len_hist <- function(tbl) {
  frag_lens <-
    mutate(
      tbl,
      frag_len = end - start
    ) |>
    filter(
      frag_len >= 30 &
        frag_len <= 500
    ) |>
    pull(frag_len)

  hist(
    frag_lens,
    breaks = seq(30, 500, 1),
    plot = FALSE
  )
}
```

```{r}
atac_frag_lens <- fragment_len_hist(atac_tbl)
```

The `density` slot contains a vector of densities at base-pair resolution. We will use `acf()` to calculate the autocorrelation of these values, and will store the tidied result.

```{r}
#| echo: true
atac_acf_tbl <-
  acf(
    atac_frag_lens$density,
    lag.max = 40,
    plot = FALSE
  ) |>
  broom::tidy()

atac_acf_tbl
```

Now let's plot the autocorrelation.

```{r}
plot_acf <- function(tbl, title) {
  ggplot(
    tbl,
    aes(lag, acf)
  ) +
    geom_point(size = 2) +
    geom_line() +
    theme_minimal_grid() +
    geom_vline(xintercept = c(10, 21), color = "red") +
    labs(title = title)
}
```

```{r}
plot_atac_acf <- plot_acf(atac_acf_tbl, title = "ATAC ACF")
plot_atac_acf
```

So, it looks like there significant bumps in autocorrelation at 10 and 21 bp positions, indicating that ATAC length distribution is periodic.

How do we confirm these bumps are interesting? Let's calculate the acf of a negative control -- the length distribution of the MNase data.

```{r}
#| label: plot-acfs
#| echo: true
#| output-location: default
mnase_frag_lens <-
  fragment_len_hist(mnase_tbl)

mnase_acf_tbl <-
  acf(
    mnase_frag_lens$density,
    lag.max = 40,
    plot = FALSE
  ) |>
  broom::tidy()

plot_mnase_acf <- plot_acf(mnase_acf_tbl, title = "MNase ACF")

# patchwork plot
plot_atac_acf / plot_mnase_acf
```

We can see a monotonic decrease in the MNase-seq data, which confirms that the bumps we see are distinctive features of ATAC-seq data.

What are these features? Consider that the specificity of binding of DNase, MNase, Tn5 is not completely generic. These enzymes have specificity of binding the minor groove of DNA, and there is an optimal geometry for the DNA substrate. You can see this in previous studies, where DNase-seq revealed high-resolution views of DNA:protein structures.

**So what then, exactly is the ~10-11 bp periodicity?** And why is this not present in MNase data?

## Visualize read density in genomic region {.smaller}

We will use the Gviz library to visualize read densities relative to a reference.

### Load tracks

First, we load the gene annotations from the [Saccharomyces Genome Databases](https://yeastgenome.org) (SGD).

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column

sgd_genes <-
  GeneRegionTrack(
    TxDb.Scerevisiae.UCSC.sacCer3.sgdGene,
    chromosome = "chrII",
    start = 530811,
    end = 540885,
  )

sgd_genes
```

Next, import the bigwig file containing yeast nucleosome-sized fragments (via MNase-seq) using `rtracklayer::import.bw()`.

Inspect the object. What is "GRanges"?

```{r}
#| echo: true
mnase_nuc_gr <- import.bw(
  here("data/block-dna/yeast_mnase_134_160.bw"),
  as = "GRanges"
)
mnase_nuc_gr
```

Next, load the GRanges object as a track for Gviz to plot:

```{r}
mnase_nuc_trk <- DataTrack(
  mnase_nuc_gr,
  name = "MNase_nuc"
)
mnase_nuc_trk
```

Now, we can make a plot for this particular region of chrII:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column
plotTracks(
  c(
    sgd_genes,
    mnase_nuc_trk
  ),
  from = 530811,
  to = 540885,
  chromosome = "chrII",
  transcriptAnnotation = "gene",
  shape = "arrow",
  type = "histogram"
)
```

## Load the remaining data

That looks great! Let's load all the other data sets.

1.  Load each bigWig as a GRanges object with `rtracklayer::import.bw()`
2.  Convert each to a `Gviz::DataTrack()` for plotting

We can do this one of two ways. We can do it one-by-one:

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
# do this for each of the four tracks
file_name <- "yeast_mnase_lt50.bw"
track_name <- "MNase_Short"
big_wig <- import.bw(here("data/block-dna", file_name))
data_track <- DataTrack(big_wig, track_name)
```

Or we can create a tibble with file and track names, and use purrr to load and convert each one:

```{r}
#| echo: true
track_info <-
  tibble(
    file_name = c(
      "yeast_mnase_lt50.bw",
      "yeast_mnase_134_160.bw",
      "yeast_atac_lt120.bw",
      "yeast_atac_gt120.bw"
    ),
    track_name = c(
      "MNase_Short", "MNase_Long",
      "ATAC_Short", "ATAC_Long"
    )
  ) |>
  mutate(
    file_path = here("data/block-dna", file_name),
    big_wig = purrr::map(
      file_path, ~ import.bw(.x, as = "GRanges")
    ),
    data_track = purrr::map2(
      big_wig, track_name, ~ DataTrack(.x, name = .y)
    )
  )
```

Now, we just have to make a list of tracks to plot and Gviz takes care of the rest.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
plotTracks(
  c(
    sgd_genes,
    track_info$data_track
  ),
  from = 530811,
  to = 540885,
  chromosome = "chrII",
  transcriptAnnotation = "gene",
  shape = "arrow",
  type = "histogram"
)
```

## Interpretations

Recall this plot:

![](../img/block-dna/mnase-overview.png)

Some questions to think about as you look at the tracks:

1.  What is each data set reporting on?
2.  What can you infer about genome function based on these tracks?
3.  What are the major differences between MNase-seq and ATAC-seq based on these tracks?
