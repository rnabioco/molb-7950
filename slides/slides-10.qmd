## Learning objective stats-bootcamp

-   Familiarity with probabilities, distributions, and descriptive statistics

-   Perform exploratory data analysis

-   Know which statistical methods are appropriate for your data

-   Understand and execute different statistical approaches

-   "You can't be neutral on a moving train"

## Class overview

-   Motivation for why stats are important

-   History of stats

## Why do we need to know statistics?

As **scientists** we need to assign confidence to our results.

-   Convince ourselves

-   Convince other scientists

-   Convince the public (additional challenges)

## Stats + probability are not intuitive

-   See patterns where there are none
-   Miss patterns we are NOT expecting
-   We tend to be overconfident
-   Bad at Bayesian thinking
-   Don't do well with dependencies
-   Don't update expectations with new evidence

## See patterns where there are none {.smaller}

# flip a coin
sample(x = c("H", "T"), size = 100, replace = T)
```

[Need help! My friend thinks coin flips are 50-50!](https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/need-help-my-stupid-friend-thinks-coin-flips-are-50-50.60279/)

## Miss existing patterns

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Correlation_examples2.svg/2880px-Correlation_examples2.svg.png)

ALWAYS visualize your data.

## Let's flip a fair coin {.smaller}

Flip a coin 5 times with equal prob of H or T

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment

rbinom(n = 5, size = 1, prob = .5)
```

Again

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment

rbinom(n = 5, size = 1, prob = .5)
```

. . .

Set a seed

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment

#
set.seed(33)
rbinom(n = 5, size = 1, prob = .5)
```

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment

#
set.seed(33)
rbinom(n = 5, size = 1, prob = .5)
```

## Let's flip an unfair coin {.smaller}

Flip a coin 5 times with equal prob of H or T

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment

rbinom(n = 5, size = 1, prob = .2)
```

Again

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment

rbinom(n = 5, size = 1, prob = .2)
```

## Let's summarize the flipping results {.smaller}

Flip a fair coin 10

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment

rbinom(n = 10, size = 1, prob = .5)
```

Flip a fair coin 10 and calculate mean

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment

rbinom(n = 10, size = 1, prob = .5) |>
  mean()
```

Again

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment

rbinom(n = 10, size = 1, prob = .5) |>
  mean()
```

. . .

Unfair coin

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment

rbinom(n = 10, size = 1, prob = .2) |>
  mean()
```

Unfair coin, again

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment

rbinom(n = 10, size = 1, prob = .2) |>
  mean()
```

## Let's go wild flipping {.smaller}

Flip a fair coin 10 times and calculate mean. Then do 5 rounds of that experiment.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment

numFlips <- 10
numRounds <- 5

myFairTosses <- vector()

for (i in 1:numRounds) {
  myFairTosses[i] <- rbinom(n = numFlips, size = 1, prob = .5) |> mean()
}

myFairTosses
```

. . .

Same thing for an unfair coin.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment

myUnfairTosses <- vector()

for (i in 1:numRounds) {
  myUnfairTosses[i] <- rbinom(n = numFlips, size = 1, prob = .2) |> mean()
}

myUnfairTosses
```

## Tidy and visualize flips {.smaller}

make a dataframe with means and accompanying info

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment

allFlips <- tibble(
  fair = myFairTosses,
  unfair = myUnfairTosses
) |>
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c("fair", "unfair"),
    names_to = "cheating",
    values_to = "avg"
  )

allFlips |> top_n(5)
```

. . .

plot it

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
#| fig.alt: "Description of the plot - PLEASE FILL IN"

ggplot(allFlips, aes(x = cheating, y = avg, color = cheating)) +
  geom_jitter() +
  stat_summary(
    fun = mean,
    geom = "point",
    shape = 18,
    size = 3,
    color = "grey"
  ) +
  ylim(-0.05, 1.05) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = .5, linetype = "dashed") + # true mean fair
  geom_hline(yintercept = .2, linetype = "dashed") + # true mean unfair
  theme_cowplot()
```

## Play around some more {.smaller}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
#| fig.alt: "Description of the plot - PLEASE FILL IN"

numFlips <- 50
numRounds <- 5

myFairTosses <- vector()

for (i in 1:numRounds) {
  myFairTosses[i] <- rbinom(n = numFlips, size = 1, prob = .5) |> mean()
}

myUnfairTosses <- vector()

for (i in 1:numRounds) {
  myUnfairTosses[i] <- rbinom(n = numFlips, size = 1, prob = .2) |> mean()
}

tibble(

  unfair = myUnfairTosses
) |>
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c("fair", "unfair"),

## The Monty Hall Problem

> Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice? \~ (From Parade magazine's Ask Marilyn column)

## Pick a door, any door

![](/img/montyhall_1.jpg)

## Will you switch?

![](/img/montyhall_2.jpg)

## Switching improves your odds 2x

Say you choose Door #1

+------------+------------+------------+----------------+------------+
| Behind\    | Behind\    | Behind\    | Result if STAY | Result if\ |
| Door 1     | Door 2     | Door 3     |                | SWITCH     |
+============+============+============+================+============+
| **Car**    | Goat       | Goat       | **Car**        | Goat       |

## You can't be neutral on a moving train

Howard Zinn: "To Be Neutral, To Be Passive In A Situation Is To Collaborate With Whatever Is Going On"

```         
Zinn, a prolific writer and scholar, tore down the wall intended to separate activism — or partisanship — from the professed objectivity of scholarship. Instead Zinn told his students that he did not

“pretend to an objectivity that was neither possible nor desirable. ‘You can’t be neutral on a moving train,’ I would tell them...Events are already moving in certain deadly directions, and to be neutral means to accept that.”

Zinn is writing in response to the timeless questions that burn within anyone who cares about creating a more just society and world. Is change possible? Where will it come from? Can we actually make a difference? How do you remain hopeful?
```

-   Sir Francis Galton (1822-1911)
-   Karl Pearson (1857-1936)
-   Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher (1890-1962)

## Sir Francis Galton (1822-1911)

-   Discovered regression to the mean

-   Re-discovered correlation and regression and discovered how to apply these in anthropology, psychology, and more

-   Defined the concept of standard deviation

-   Established the field of Eugenics in 1883

-   Darwin's cousin.

## Galton's reasoning for coining the term eugenics:

> "We greatly want a brief word to express the science of improving stock, which...takes cognisance of all influences that tend in however remote a degree to give the more suitable races or strains of blood a better chance of prevailing speedily over the less suitable than they otherwise would have had."

## Karl Pearson (1857-1936)

Pearson was Galton's protege and developed/contributed to:

-   Developed hypothesis testing

-   Developed the use of p-values

-   Defined the Chi-Squared test

-   Correlation coefficient

-   Principle components analysis

## Pearson authored of timeless "classics" such as:

[The Woman's Question](https://archive.org/details/ethicoffreethoug00pear/page/370/mode/2up?view=theater)

[National Life from the standpoint of science](https://archive.org/details/nationallifefro00peargoog/page/n12/mode/2up?view=theater)

## Pearson, eugenics, and anti-semitism

In the year Mein Kampf was published, Pearson wrote an article called:\
[**THE PROBLEM OF ALIEN IMMIGRATION INTO GREAT BRITAIN, ILLUSTRATED BY AN EXAMINATION OF RUSSIAN AND POLISH JEWISH CHILDREN**](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-1809.1925.tb02037.x)

> "\[they\] will develop into a parasitic race...Taken *on the average*, and regarding both sexes, this alien Jewish population is somewhat inferior physically and mentally to the native population."

## Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher (1890-1962)

Fisher's work established many important methods of statistical inference.

-   The iris dataset

-   Establishing p = 0.05 as the normal threshold for significant p-values

-   Promoting Maximum Likelihood Estimation

-   Developing the ANalysis Of VAriance (ANOVA)

-   [The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Genetical_Theory_of_Natural_Selection), which blended the work of Mendel and Darwin.

## Fisher and eugenics

There is no lack of Fisher's strong and consistent support for eugenics. Here is an example from as late as 1954.

![Letter from R.A. Fisher to R. Ruggles Gates. Ronald Fisher Archive. University of Adelaide.](/img/fisher_gates.jpg)

## Storytime, pt I

-   Galton founded the Eugenics Record Office (1904)

-   Galton Eugenics Laboratory within University College London (UCL). Created by Pearson and funded by Galton. (1907)

-   Galton left UCL enough money to create a Chair in National Eugenics, filled by Pearson and then Fisher.

-   *Annals of Human Genetics* was established in 1925 Pearson as the Annals of Eugenics, and obtained its current name in 1954.

-   Galton laboratory was incorporated into the Department of Eugenics, Biometry and Genetic at UCL in 1944.

## Storytime, cont.

-   Renamed to the Department of Human Genetics and Biometry in 1966.

-   Became part of the Department of Biology at UCL in 1996.

-   In 2020: [UCL renames three facilities that honoured prominent eugenicists](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/jun/19/ucl-renames-three-facilities-that-honoured-prominent-eugenicists)

-   **These views did not appear to be common at UCL in the 1930s. For example, they were not held by JBS Haldane, Egon Pearson (son of Karl), and Lionel Penrose.**

## Just a product of their time

From: [Statistics, Eugenics, and Me](https://towardsdatascience.com/statistics-eugenics-and-me-29eaf43efac7)

```         
Sitting idly by as this happens will make us ‘a product of their time’. This is not good enough. Data Science needs more regulation. Doctors have the Hippocratic Oath, why don’t we have the Nightingale Oath: “Manipulate no data nor results. Promote ethical uses of statistics. Only train models you understand. Don’t promote Eugenics”.
