## Final Projects

Throughout the DNA and RNA blocks will refer to several data sets that might be good starting points for your final project (worth 20% of your grade).

We will ask for a sketch of the rough plan for a final project by the end of week 7 (Fri Oct 11). In addition, if you plan to work in a group, we'd like to know who you will be working with.

**Final projects will be due Friday Nov 3. We will schedule short (5 minute) talks by each group on Oct 28 and Oct 29.**

## Mapping & measurement are first steps toward understanding. {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
Before genome-wide DNA accessibility measurements, we knew about chromatin transactions at only a handful of loci.

This was a classic "keys under the lamppost" situation, leading to general models of chromatin-based gene regulation.

## Using micrococcal nuclease (MNase) to map chromatin {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column .nonincremental width="50%"}
-   Micrococcal nuclease is an endo/exonuclease from *Staphylococcus aureus*
-   Efficient, **multiple turnover** enzyme that digests accessible DNA (& RNA)
-   Dependent on calcium (Ca2+)

## Using ATAC to map chromatin {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column .nonincremental width="50%"}
-   Tn5 transposase catalyzes "cut-and-paste" insertion of DNA into a target
-   In ATAC ("Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin"), the transposase enzymes are loaded with DNA sequencing adaptors (blue and red in the image), so the products of transposition are ready to PCR.
-   **Single turnover enzyme** that acts on accessible DNA.
-   Requires about \~60 bp of accessible for transposition.

### BED format {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column .nonincremental width="50%"}
-   Contains information about genomic intervals.
-   Used to represent genomic features (exons, introns, transcription start sites)
-   First 3 columns are: `chrom`, `start`, `end`
-   Next 3 are: `name`, `score`, `strand`. Strand can be `+`, `-`, or `.` (no strand)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

### WIG / bedGraph {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column .nonincremental width="50%"}
-   WIG and bedGraph store interval *signals*.

    -   Genome sequencing coverage
    -   Coverage of reads from MNase / ATAC-seq

-   Many studies will provide genome-scale data in these formats
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```         
chr19 49302000 49302300 -1.0
chr19 49302300 49302600 -0.75
chr19 49302600 49302900 -0.50
chr19 49302900 49303200 -0.25
```
:::
:::

::: aside
bigWig is a binary form of WIG, used to store large amounts of signal in a compressed, indexed format.

## Interval analysis {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
The primary tool in the genome interval analysis is [BEDtools](https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) -- it's the Swiss-army knife of internal analysis.

We wrote an R package called [valr](https://rnabioco.github.io/valr/) that provides the same tools, but you don't need to leave RStudio. valr provides the same tools for reading and manipulating genome intervals.

`bed_intersect()` is a fundamental operation. It identifies intervals from two tibbles that intersect and reports their overlaps.

Let's take a look at that it does.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

## `bed_intersect()` example {.smaller}

```{r}
#| label: bed-intersect
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column
library(valr)
library(dplyr)

x <- tribble(
  ~chrom, ~start, ~end,
  "chr1", 25, 50,
  "chr1", 100, 125
)

y <- tribble(
  ~chrom, ~start, ~end,
  "chr1", 30,     75
)

bed_intersect(x, y)
```

## valr example

You can use `read_bed()` and related functions to load genome annotations and signals.

```{r}
#| label: valr-example
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
library(valr)

snps <- read_bed(
  valr_example("hg19.snps147.chr22.bed.gz"),
  n_fields = 6
)

genes <- read_bed(
  valr_example("genes.hg19.chr22.bed.gz"),
  n_fields = 6
)
```

::: aside
We'll also use the valr functions `read_bedgraph()` and `read_bigwig()`.
:::

## What is in `snps` and `genes`? {.smaller}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column
head(snps)
```

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column
head(genes)
```

## Interval manipulation {.smaller}

Let's find and characterize intergenic SNPs. We'll use the tools `bed_substract()` and `bed_closest()`. Take a look and their examples in the documentation to see what they do.

```{r}
#| label: valr-ints
#| echo: true
# find snps in intergenic regions
intergenic <- bed_subtract(snps, genes)

# find distance from intergenic snps to nearest gene
nearby <- bed_closest(intergenic, genes)
```

. . .

Take a look at the `intergenic` and `nearby` objects in the console.

## Interval manipulation {.smaller}

Now that you have overlaps and distances between SNPs and genes, you can go back to dplyr tools to generate reports.

```{r}
#| label: valr-dplyr
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
library(dplyr)

nearby |>
  select(
    starts_with("name"),
    .overlap,
    .dist
  ) |>
  filter(abs(.dist) < 5000)
```

## `bed_map()` example

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
`bed_map()` does two things in order:

::: nonincremental
1.  It identifies intersecting intervals between `x` and `y`
2.  Calculates summary statistics based on the intersection
:::

A typical use is to count up signals (e.g., coverage from an MNase-seq experiment) over specific regions (e.g., promoter regions).
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

:::
:::

## `bed_map()` example {.smaller}

Copy / paste these into your console.

```{r}
#| echo: true
x <- tribble(
  ~chrom, ~start, ~end,
  "chr1", 100,    250,
  "chr2", 250,    500
)

y <- tribble(
  ~chrom, ~start, ~end, ~value,
  "chr1", 100,    250,  10,
  "chr1", 150,    250,  20,
  "chr2", 250,    500,  500
)
```

## `bed_map()` example continued {.smaller}

First examine the intersecting intervals.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
bed_intersect(x, y)
```

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
bed_map(
  x, y,
  .sum = sum(value),
  .count = length(value)
)
```
