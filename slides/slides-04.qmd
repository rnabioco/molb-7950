## *ggplot2*

ggplot2 is based on the "grammar of graphics", the idea that you can build every graph from the same components: a data set, a coordinate system, and "geoms" - visual marks that represent data points.

## Today's datasets

In this class, we will use a data set from ggplot2: `diamonds` contains thousands of gem prices and qualities.

There are many interesting data sets you can install as R packages for learning to manipulate and plot data:

::: {.nonincremental}
- [babynames](https://hadley.github.io/babynames/)
- [gapminder](https://jennybc.github.io/gapminder/)
- [palmerpenguins](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/)
:::

## Getting familiar with the data - Exercise 1 {.smaller}

```{r}
#| echo: true
summary(diamonds)
```

. . .

Also examine:

```r
?diamonds
head(diamonds)
glimpse(diamonds)
View(diamonds)
```

## The syntax of `ggplot()`  

`ggplot()` builds plots piece by piece.

ggplot divides a plot into three different fundamental parts:

plot = _data_ + _coordinate-system_ + _geometry_.  

![](../img/ggplot2/ggplot-syntax.png)

---

**aesthetics** map variables in the data to visual
properties of the geom like `size`, `color`, and `x`
and `y` locations.

![](../img/ggplot2/ggplot-aesthetics.png)

## Making a plot step-by-step (Exercise 2)

---

Initialize a plot with data.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: slide
ggplot(data = diamonds)
```

---

Next, specify the coordinate system.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: slide
#| code-line-numbers: "3-5"
ggplot(
  data = diamonds,
  mapping = aes(
    x = carat,
    y = price
  )
)
```

---

Add a geom (`geom_point`).

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: slide
#| code-line-numbers: "8"
ggplot(
  data = diamonds,
  mapping = aes(
    x = carat,
    y = price
  )
) +
  geom_point()
```

---

Map aesthetics to other variables.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: slide
#| code-line-numbers: "6-7"
ggplot(
  data = diamonds,
  mapping = aes(
    x = carat,
    y = price,
    color = cut,
    size = carat
  )
) +
  geom_point()
```

---

Reduce overplotting by adjusting the transparency of points.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: slide
#| code-line-numbers: "10"
ggplot(
  data = diamonds,
  mapping = aes(
    x = carat,
    y = price,
    color = cut,
    size = carat
  )
) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2)
```

## Looking under the hood of ggplot (Exercise 3) {.smaller}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: slide
p <- ggplot(
  data = diamonds,
  mapping = aes(
    x = carat,
    y = price,
    color = cut,
    size = carat
  )
) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2)

summary(p)
```

## ggplot is powerfully simple for making complex plots

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
ggplot(
  diamonds,
  aes(x = carat)
) +
  geom_histogram()
```

. . .

Note you can drop the `data` and `mapping` specifications, as `ggplot`
expects these as the first two arguments. See `?ggplot`.

---

Why can't I just do this?

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
hist(diamonds$carat)
```

. . . 

You can. But the advantage of ggplot is that it is equally "simple" to make basic and complex plots.

The underlying grammar lets you exquisitely customize the appearance of your plot and easily generate *reproducible & publishable* figures. 

## Creating more complex plots

![](../img/ggplot2/ggplot-layers.png)

## Geom functions

* Use a geom function to represent data points, use the geom aesthetic properties to represent variables.
* Each function returns a plot layer.
* There are many geoms in ggplot that are specific to plots with 1, 2, or 3 variables 

## Geom functions for one variable - Exercise 4

![](../img/ggplot2/ggplot-1variable.png)

---

Make a bar plot.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
ggplot(
  data = diamonds,
  mapping = aes(x = cut)
) +
  geom_bar()
```

---

Update the bar plot aesthetics.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
#| code-line-numbers: "3-6"
ggplot(
  data = diamonds,
  mapping = aes(
    x = cut,
    fill = clarity
  )
) +
  geom_bar()
```

---

Change to a density plot.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
#| code-line-numbers: "5"
ggplot(
  data = diamonds,
  mapping = aes(x = carat)
) +
  geom_density()
```

---

Color the density plot.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
#| code-line-numbers: "5"
ggplot(
  data = diamonds,
  mapping = aes(x = carat)
) +
  geom_density(
    fill = "tomato1"
  )
```

---

Plot subsets by mapping `fill` to `cut`

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
ggplot(
  data = diamonds,
  mapping = aes(
    x = carat,
    fill = cut
  )
) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.8)
```

---

Use `ggridges` to plot staggered subsets.

https://wilkelab.org/ggridges/

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
#| code-line-numbers: "9-10"
ggplot(
  data = diamonds,
  mapping = aes(
    x = carat,
    y = cut,
    fill = cut
  )
) +
  # geom from `ggridges`
  geom_density_ridges()
```

## Geom functions for two variables

With two variables, depending on the nature of the data, you can have different
kinds of geoms:

  - discrete x, continuous y
  - continuous x, continuous y
  - continuous bivariate
  - & others (check out the cheatsheet!)
  
## discrete x, continuous y - Exercise 5

![](../img/ggplot2/ggplot-geom-dx-cy.png)

---

Make a column plot.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
ggplot(
  data = diamonds,
  mapping = aes(
    x = cut,
    y = price
  )
) +
  geom_col()
```

---

Same data with a box plot.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
ggplot(
  data = diamonds,
  mapping = aes(
    x = cut,
    y = price
  )
) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

---

Box plot, with fill color by cut.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
ggplot(
  data = diamonds,
  mapping = aes(
    x = cut,
    y = price,
    fill = cut
  )
) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

. . .

What about this plot is not ideal? (hint: how many ways is `cut` represented?)

---

Violin plot with fill color by cut.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
ggplot(
  data = diamonds,
  mapping = aes(
    x = cut,
    y = price,
    fill = cut
  )
) +
  geom_violin()
```

## continuous x, continuous y - Exercise 6

![](../img/ggplot2/ggplot-geom-cx-cy.png)

---

Subset diamonds to see points more clearly.

```{r}
#| echo: true
diamonds_subset <- diamonds |>
  sample_n(size = 1000)
```

---

Make a scatter plot.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
ggplot(
  data = diamonds_subset,
  mapping = aes(
    x = carat,
    y = price,
    color = cut
  )
) +
  geom_point()
```

Now add a smoothing line.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
ggplot(
  data = diamonds_subset,
  mapping = aes(
    x = carat,
    y = price,
    color = cut
  )
) +
  geom_smooth()
```

---

Here we can combine geoms to see points & the fit

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: slide
ggplot(
  data = diamonds_subset,
  mapping = aes(
    x = carat,
    y = price,
    color = cut
  )
) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()
```

# Class 4 End

## continuous bivariate - Exercise 7

![](../img/ggplot2/ggplot-geom-cont-bivar.png)

---

```{r fig.height=3, fig.width=3}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
ggplot(
  data = diamonds_subset,
  mapping = aes(
    x = carat,
    y = price
  )
) +
  geom_point()
```

```{r fig.height=3, fig.width=3}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
ggplot(
  data = diamonds_subset,
  mapping = aes(
    x = carat,
    y = price
  )
) +
  geom_hex()
```

## shape, size, fill, color, and transparency - Exercise 9

R has 25 built in shapes that are identified by numbers.

Some are similar: 0, 15, and 22 are all squares, but interact differently with `color` and `fill` aesthetics.

Hollow shapes have a border determined by `color`, solid shapes (15-18) are
filled with `color`, an the filled shapes (21-24) have `color` border and `fill`
inside.

![](../img/ggplot2/ggplot-shapes.png)

---

Note that aesthetics can also be defined *within* a geoms.

This is useful if you use two different geoms that share an aesthetic.

```{r fig.height=3, fig.width=4}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
ggplot(
  data = diamonds_subset,
  mapping = aes(
    x = carat,
    y = price
  )
) +
  geom_point(
    aes(
      fill = cut,
      size = depth
    ),
    alpha = 0.8,
    shape = 24,
    color = "white"
  )
```

## Position adjustments - Exercise 10

Position adjustments determine how to arrange geoms that would otherwise occupy the same space.

![](../img/ggplot2/ggplot-position.png)

---

A stacked bar chart.

```{r fig.height=3, fig.width=5}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
ggplot(
  data = diamonds,
  mapping = aes(
    x = cut,
    fill = clarity
  )
) +
  geom_bar()
```

---

Dodged bars are easier to read (proportions are clearer)

```{r fig.height=3, fig.width=5}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
ggplot(
  data = diamonds,
  mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = clarity)
) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge")
```

## Coordinate and Scale Functions - Exercise 11

We won't go into these functions too much today, but here is a brief overview: 

* The coordinate system determines how the x and y aesthetics combine to position elements in the plot. The default coordinate system is Cartesian ( coord_cartesian() ), which can be tweaked with coord_map() , coord_fixed() , coord_flip() , and coord_trans() , or completely replaced with coord_polar()

* Scales control the details of how data values are translated to visual properties. There are 20+ scale functions. We will look at one; the ggplot2 cheatsheet is your friend for the rest. 
---

Logarithmic axes - 1

Note the difference between axis labels in these two examples.

```{r fig.height=3, fig.width=3}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
ggplot(
  diamonds_subset,
  aes(carat, price)
) +
  geom_point() +
  coord_trans(x = "log10")
```

---

Logarithmic axes - 2

```{r fig.height=3, fig.width=3}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
ggplot(
  diamonds_subset,
  aes(carat, price)
) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10()
```

---

Flipping coordinate system (swapping `x` and `y`)

```{r fig.height=3, fig.width=5}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
ggplot(
  data = diamonds,
  mapping = aes(x = cut)
) +
  geom_bar()
```

---

Now flip the axis.

```{r fig.width=5}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
ggplot(
  data = diamonds,
  mapping = aes(x = cut)
) +
  geom_bar() +
  coord_flip()
```

---

Brief aside: ggplot can handle on-the-fly data transformations. 

Here we log-transform carat and convert USD to CAD.

```{r fig.height=3, fig.width=3}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
ggplot(
  data = diamonds_subset,
  aes(
    x = log10(carat),
    y = price * 1.32
  )
) +
  geom_point()
```

## Zooming into a plot - Exercise 12

---

We might want to change the limits of x or y axes to zoom in.

```{r fig.height=3, fig.width=3}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
ggplot(
  diamonds_subset,
  aes(carat, price)
) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  xlim(0, 2) +
  ylim(0, 5000)
```

. . . 

You can also use `coord_cartesian(xlim, ylim)`

## Faceting to plot subsets of data into separate panels - Exercise 13

"Facets" are a powerful tool to subdivide a plot based on the values of one or more discrete variables.

![](../img/ggplot2/ggplot-facet.png)

---

Density plot we've seen before. Which variables can we use to subdivide the data?

```{r fig.height=3, fig.width=7}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
ggplot(
  data = diamonds,
  mapping = aes(x = carat, fill = cut)
) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.8)
```

---

Faceted by `cut`

```{r fig.height=2, fig.width=7}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
ggplot(
  data = diamonds,
  mapping = aes(x = log(price), fill = cut)
) +
  geom_density(color = "black") +
  facet_wrap(~cut, nrow = 1)
```

---

Scatter plot with facets.

```{r fig.height=2, fig.width=7}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
ggplot(
  data = diamonds,
  mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price, color = cut)
) +
  geom_point(alpha = .05) +
  facet_wrap(~cut, nrow = 1)
```

## Themes - Exercise 14

Themes can significantly affect the appearance of your plot. Thanksfully, there are a lot to choose from. 

![](../img/ggplot2/ggplot-themes.png)

---

Scatter plot with default theme. 

```{r fig.height=3, fig.width=4}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
ggplot(
  data = diamonds_subset,
  mapping = aes(
    x = carat,
    y = price,
    color = cut
  )
) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.8)
```

---

Change the theme with `theme_bw()`.

```{r fig.height=3, fig.width=4}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
#| code-line-numbers: "10"
ggplot(
  data = diamonds_subset,
  mapping = aes(
    x = carat,
    y = price,
    color = cut
  )
) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.8) +
  theme_bw()
```

---

My go-to is `cowplot::theme_cowplot()`.

It implements much of the advice in the "Dataviz" book, e.g. YOUR LABELS ARE TOO
SMALL.

```{r fig.height=3, fig.width=4}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
#| code-line-numbers: "10"
ggplot(
  data = diamonds_subset,
  mapping = aes(
    x = carat,
    y = price,
    color = cut
  )
) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.8) +
  theme_cowplot()
```

. . .

We're not going to cover it, but you can also customize pre-existing themes.

## Labels & Legends - Exercise 15
    
![](../img/ggplot2/ggplot-labels-legends.png)

---

Use `labs()` to add / change plot labels.

```{r fig.height=3, fig.width=5}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
#| code-line-numbers: "10-17"
ggplot(
  data = diamonds,
  mapping = aes(
    x = cut,
    y = log(price),
    fill = cut
  )
) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(
    x = "Cut",
    y = "Price (log)",
    color = "Cut",
    title = "Distribution of diamond prices by cut",
    subtitle = "Data come from a random sample of 1000 diamonds",
    caption = "Source: diamonds dataset from ggplot2"
  ) +
  theme_cowplot()
```

# *Additional points*

## How to add a line to a plot? (Exercise 16)

```{r fig.height=3, fig.width=4}
p <- ggplot(
  data = diamonds_subset,
  mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price, color = cut)
) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.8) +
  theme_cowplot()

p + geom_line()
p + geom_hline(aes(yintercept = 5000))
p + geom_vline(aes(xintercept = 2))
p + geom_smooth(method = lm)
p + geom_abline(aes(intercept = 0.5, slope = 5000))
```

## How to combine multiple plots into a figure? (Exercise 17)

```{r fig.height=4, fig.width=6}
plot1 <- p
plot2 <- p + geom_hline(aes(yintercept = 5000))
plot3 <- p + geom_vline(aes(xintercept = 2))
plot4 <- p + geom_abline(aes(intercept = 0.5, slope = 5000))

all_plots <- plot_grid(plot1, plot2, plot3, plot4, labels = c("A", "B", "C", "D"), nrow = 2)
all_plots

# we have 4 legends, which is too many - can they be removed?
# Yes, but it is not exactly straightforward
legend <- get_legend(plot1 + theme(legend.position = "bottom"))
plot1 <- p + theme(legend.position = "none")
plot2 <- p + geom_hline(aes(yintercept = 5000)) + theme(legend.position = "none")
plot3 <- p + geom_vline(aes(xintercept = 2)) + theme(legend.position = "none")
plot4 <- p + geom_abline(aes(intercept = 0.5, slope = 5000)) + theme(legend.position = "none")

all_plots <- plot_grid(plot1, plot2, plot3, plot4, labels = c("A", "B", "C", "D"), nrow = 2)
plot_final <- plot_grid(all_plots, legend, ncol = 1, rel_heights = c(1, .1))
plot_final
```

More information on using plot_grid (from package `cowplot`) is [here](https://wilkelab.org/cowplot/articles/plot_grid.html)

## Saving plots (Exercise 18)

Saves last plot as 5’ x 5’ file named "plot_final.png" in working directory. Matches file type to file extension

```{r}
ggsave(here("img/plot_final.png"), width = 5, height = 5)
```
