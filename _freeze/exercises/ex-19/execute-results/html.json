We'll grab this from the UCSC download site.\n\n`read_bed()` and `read_genom()` are valr functions.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Load signals {.smaller}\n\nNext we'll load bigWigs for the ATAC and MNase experiments, containing either short or long fragments.\n\nRecall that the information encoded in short and long fragments should be reflected in our interpretations.\n\nFirst, we make a tibble of file paths and metadata.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n---\n\nNext, we need to read in the bigWig files. We use `purrr::map` to apply `read_bigwig()`\nto each of the bigWig files, and store the results in a new column called `big_wig`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n# Meta-plots\n\n## WHY meta-plots and heatmaps?\n\nMeta-plots and heatmaps are useful for visualizing patterns of signal across many\nloci at the same time.\n\nThis is particularly useful for chromatin data, where we often want to\nunderstand how chromatin structure varies across many genes or regulatory elements\nthat share a common reference point, like transcription start sites (TSS) or\nnucleosomal midpoints.\n\n## Setting up regions for a meta-plot\n\nNext, we need to set up some windows for analyzing signal relative to each TSS.\nThis is an important step that will ultimately impact our interpretations.\n\nIn genomic meta-plots, you first decide on a window size relevant to the\nfeatures you are measuring, and then make \"windows\" around a reference point,\nspanning some distance both up- and downstream. If the features involve gene\nfeatures, we also need to take strand into account.\n\n## Setting up regions for a meta-plot\n\nReference points could be:\n\n- transcription start or end sites\n- boundaries of exons and introns\n- enhancers\n- centromeres and telomeres\n\n## Setting up regions for a meta-plot\n\nThe window size should be relevant the reference points, such that small- or\nlarge-scale features are emphasized in the plot. Moreover, the window typically\nspans some distance both up- and downstream of the reference points.\n\n## Setting up regions for a meta-plot\n\nOnce the window size has been decided, the next step is to make \"sub-windows\"\naround a reference point. If gene features are involved, we also need to take\nstrand into account.\n\n## Setting up regions for a meta-plot\n\nFor small features like transcription factor binding sites (8-20 bp), you might\nset up smaller windows (maybe 1 bp) at a distance \\~20 bp up- and downstream of\na reference point.\n\nFor larger features like nucleosome positions or chromatin domains, you might\nset up larger windows (\\~200 bp) at distances up to \\~10 kbp up- and downstream\nof a set of reference points.\n\n## Metaplot workflow\n\n![Metaplot workflow overview](../img/block-dna/metaplot-workflow.png)\n\n## Chromatin accessibility around transcription start sites (TSSs) {.smaller}\n\n\n::: {.cell output-location='column'}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Chromatin accessibility around transcription start sites (TSSs) {.smaller}\n\nNext, we'll use two valr functions to expand the window of the reference\npoint (`bed_slop()`) and then break those windows into evenly spaced intervals\n(`bed_makewindows()`).\n\n\n::: {.cell output-location='column'}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Chromatin accessibility around transcription start sites (TSSs)\n\nAt this point, we also address the fact that the TSS data are stranded. Can someone describe what the issue is here, based on the figure above?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Chromatin accessibility around transcription start sites (TSSs) {.smaller}\n\nThis next step uses valr `bed_map()`, to calculate the total signal for each\nwindow by intersecting signals from the bigWig files.\n\n\n::: {.cell output-location='column'}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Chromatin accessibility around transcription start sites (TSSs) {.smaller}\n\nOnce we have the values from `bed_map()`, we can group by `win_coord` and\ncalculate a summary statistic for each window.\n\nRemember that `win_coord` is the same relative position for each TSS, so these\nnumbers represent a composite signal a the same position across all TSS.\n\n\n::: {.cell output-location='column'}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Meta-plot of signals around TSSs {.smaller}\n\nFinally, let's plot the data relative to TSS for each of the windows.\n\n\n::: {.cell output-location='slide'}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Interpreting the meta-plots\n\n- What is the direction of transcription in these meta-plots?\n\n- What are the features of chromatin near TSS measured by these different experimental conditions?\n\n- How do you interpret the increased signal of the +1 nucleosome in the \"MNase_Long\" condition, relative to e.g. -1, +2, +3, etc.?\n\n- What are the differences in ATAC and MNase treatments that lead to these distinctive patterns?\n\n# Heatmaps\n\n## Heatmap of signals around TSSs\n\nTo generate a heatmap, we need to reformat our data slightly.\n\nTake a look at `acc_tbl` and think about how you might reorganize the following way:\n\n- rows contain the data for individual loci (i.e., each TSS)\n- columns are ordered positions relative to the TSS (i.e., most upstream to most downstream)\n\n## Heatmap of signals around TSSs {.smaller}\n\nWe're going to plot a heatmap of the \"MNase_Long\" data. There are two ways\nto get these data\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Or, using dplyr / tidyr: {.smaller}\n\n\n::: {.cell output-location='column'}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Heatmap of signals around TSSs {.smaller}\n\nEither way, now we need to reformat the data.\n\n\n::: {.cell output-location='slide'}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Heatmap of signals around TSSs\n\nOnce we have the data reformatted, we just convert to a matrix and feed it to\n`ComplexHeatmap::Heatmap()`.\n\n\n::: {.cell output-location='slide'}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Interpreting meta-plots and heatmaps\n\nIt's worth considering what meta-plots and heatmaps *can* and *can't* tell you.\n\n1.  What are the similarities and differences between heatmaps and meta-plots?\n\n2.  What types of conclusions can you draw from each type of plot?\n\n3.  What are some features of MNase-seq and ATAC-seq that become more clear when\nlooking across many loci at the same time?\n\n4.  What are some hypotheses you can generate based on these plots?\n",
