Let's use `biomaRt` to get a table that relates gene and transcript IDs.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmart <- biomaRt::useMart(\n  \"ENSEMBL_MART_ENSEMBL\",\n  dataset = \"mmusculus_gene_ensembl\"\n)\n\nt2g <- biomaRt::getBM(\n  attributes = c(\n    \"ensembl_transcript_id\",\n    \"ensembl_gene_id\",\n    \"external_gene_name\"\n  ),\n  mart = mart\n) |>\n  as_tibble()\n\n# maps systematic to common gene names\ngene_name_map <- t2g |>\n  dplyr::select(-ensembl_transcript_id) |>\n  ??() # kill redundant\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Prepare `metdata` and import {.smaller}\n\nNow we can read in the transcript-level data and collapse to gene-level data with `tximport`\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmetadata <- data.frame(\n  sample_id = list.files(here(\"??\"),\n                         pattern = \"quant.sf\"),\n  salmon_dirs = list.files(here(\"??\"),\n                           recursive = T,\n                           pattern = \".gz$\",\n                           full.names = T)\n  ) |>\n  separate(col = sample_id, into = c(\"timepoint\",\"rep\"), sep = \"\\\\.\", remove = F)\n\nmetadata$rep <- gsub(pattern = \"Rep\", replacement = \"\", metadata$rep)\n\nrownames(metadata) <- metadata$sample_id\n\n#keep only samples we want\nmetadata <- metadata |>\n  filter(timepoint %in% c(\"??\",\"??\"))\n\nsalmdir <- metadata$??\nnames(salmdir) <- metadata$??\n\ntxi <- tximport(\n  files = salmdir,\n  type = \"salmon\",\n  tx2gene = t2g,\n  dropInfReps = TRUE,\n  countsFromAbundance = \"lengthScaledTPM\"\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Filter lowly expressed genes\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# examine distribution of TPMs\nhist(log2(1 + rowSums(txi$abundance)), breaks = 40)\n\n# decide a cutoff\nkeepG <- txi$abundance[log2(1 + rowSums(txi$abundance)) > 4.5,] |>\n  rownames()\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Create DESeq object {.smaller}\n\nThere are essentially two steps to using `DESeq2`. The first involves creating a `DESeqDataSet` from your data. Luckily, if you have a `tximport` object, which we do in the form of `txi`, then this becomes easy.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# metadata$timepoint <- as.factor(metadata$timepoint)\n\nddsTxi <- DESeqDataSetFromTximport(\n  ??,\n  colData = metadata,\n  design = ~??\n)\n\n# keep genes with sufficient expession\nddsTxi <- ddsTxi[??,]\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Design formula {.smaller}\n\nYou can see that `DESeqDataSetFromTximport` wants three things. The first is our `tximport` object. The second is the dataframe we made that relates samples and conditions (or in this case timepoints). The last is something called a **design formula**. A design formula contains all of the variables that will go into `DESeq2`'s model. The formula starts with a tilde and then has variables separated by a plus sign think `lm()`. It is common practice, and in fact basically required with `DESeq2`, to put the variable of interest last.  In our case, that's trivial because we only have one: timepoint. So our design formula is very simple:\n\n    design = ~ timepoint\n\nYour design formula should ideally include **all of the sources of variation in your data**.  For example, let's say that here we thought there was a batch effect with the replicates.  Maybe all of the Rep1 samples were prepped and sequenced on a different day than the Rep2 samples and so on. We could potentially account for this in `DESeq2`'s model with the following forumula:\n\n    design = ~ rep + timepoint\n\nHere, timepoint is still the variable of interest, but we are controlling for differences that arise due to differences in replicates.\n\n\n## Run `DESeq2` {.smaller}\n\nWe can see here that `DESeq2` is taking the counts produced by `tximport` for gene quantifications. There are 52346 genes (rows) here and 7 samples (columns). Now using this ddsTxi object, we can run `DESeq2`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndds <- DESeq(??)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThere are many useful things in this `dds` object. Take a look at the [vignette](http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html) for a full explanation. Including info on many more tests and analyses that can be done with `DESeq2`.\n\nThe results can be accessed using the `results()` function. We will use the `contrast` argument here. `DESeq2` reports changes in RNA abundance between two samples as a `log2FoldChange`. But, it's often not clear what the numerator and denominator of that fold change ratio...it could be either DIV7/DIV0 or DIV0/DIV7.\n\nThe lexographically first condition will be the numerator. I find it easier to explicitly specify what the numerator and denominator of this ratio are using the `contrast` argument. The `contrast` argument can be used to implement more complicated design formula. Remember our design formula that accounted for potential differences due to Replicate batch effects:\n\n    ~ replicate + timepoint\n\n`DESeq2` will account for differences between replicates here to find differences between timepoints.\n\n## Contrasts to get results {.smaller}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# For contrast, we give three strings: the factor we are interested in, the numerator, and the denominator\nresults(dds, contrast = c(\"timepoint\", \"??\", \"??\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe columns we are most interested in are **log2FoldChange** and **padj**.\n\nlog2FoldChange is self-explanatory. padj is the Benjamini-Hochberg corrected pvalue for a test asking if the expression of this gene is different between the two conditions.\n\n## Cleanup results {.smaller}\n\nLet's do a little work on this data frame to make it slightly cleaner and more informative.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndiff <-\n  results(\n    dds,\n    contrast = c(\"timepoint\", \"DIV7\", \"DIV0\")\n  ) |>\n  # Change this into a dataframe\n  ??() |>\n  # Move ensembl gene IDs into their own column\n  ??(var = \"ensembl_gene_id\") |>\n  # drop unused columns\n  dplyr::select(-c(baseMean, lfcSE, stat, pvalue)) |>\n  # Merge this with a table relating ensembl_gene_id with gene symbols\n  inner_join(??) |>\n  # Rename external_gene_name column\n  dplyr::rename(gene = external_gene_name) |>\n  as_tibble()\n```\n:::\n\n\n## How many are significant {.smaller}\n\nOK now we have a table of gene expression results. How many genes are significantly up/down regulated between these two timepoints?\nWe will use 0.01 as an FDR (p.adj) cutoff.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# number of upregulated genes\nnrow(filter(diff, padj < ?? & log2FoldChange > ??))\n\n# number of downregulated genes\nnrow(filter(diff, padj < ?? & log2FoldChange < ??))\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Volcano plot of differential expression results {.smaller}\n\nLet's make a volcano plot of these results.\n\n\n::: {.cell output-location='slide'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# meets the FDR cutoff\ndiff_sig <-\n  mutate(\n    diff,\n    sig = case_when(\n      padj < ?? ~ \"yes\",\n      .default = \"no\"\n    )\n  ) |>\n  # if a gene did not meet expression cutoffs that DESeq2 automatically does, it gets a pvalue of NA\n  drop_na()\n\nggplot(\n  diff_sig,\n  aes(\n    x = ??,\n    y = ??,\n    color = sig\n  )\n) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.2) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"DIV7 expression / DIV0 expression, log2\",\n    y = \"-log10(FDR)\"\n  ) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    values = c(\"black\", \"red\"),\n    labels = c(\"NS\", \"FDR < 0.01\"),\n    name = \"\"\n  ) +\n  theme_cowplot()\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Change the LFC threshold {.smaller}\n\nIn addition to an FDR cutoff, let's also apply a log2FoldChange cutoff. This will of course be more conservative, but will probably give you a more confident set of genes.\n\n\n::: {.cell output-location='column-fragment'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Is the expression of the gene at least 3-fold different?\ndiff_lfc <-\n  results(dds,\n    contrast = c(\"timepoint\", \"DIV7\", \"DIV0\"),\n    lfcThreshold = log2(??)\n    ) |>\n  # Change this into a dataframe\n  as.data.frame() |>\n  # Move ensembl gene IDs into their own column\n  rownames_to_column(var = \"ensembl_gene_id\") |>\n  # drop unused columns\n  dplyr::select(-c(baseMean, lfcSE, stat, pvalue)) |>\n  # Merge this with a table relating ensembl_gene_id with gene short names\n  inner_join(gene_name_map) |>\n  # Rename external_gene_name column\n  dplyr::rename(gene = external_gene_name) |>\n  as_tibble()\n\n# number of upregulated genes\nnrow(\n  filter(\n    diff_lfc, padj < 0.01 & log2FoldChange > 0\n    )\n  )\n\n# number of downregulated genes\nnrow(\n  filter(\n    diff_lfc, padj < 0.01 & log2FoldChange < 0\n    )\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Change the LFC threshold {.smaller}\n\n\n::: {.cell output-location='column-fragment'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndiff_lfc_sig <-\n  mutate(\n    diff_lfc,\n    sig = case_when(\n      padj < 0.01 ~ \"yes\",\n      .default = \"no\"\n    )\n  ) |>\n  drop_na()\n\n\n# look at some specific genes\ndiff_lfc_sig |>\n  filter(?? %in%\nc(\"Bdnf\",\"Dlg4\",\"Klf4\",\"Sox2\")) |>\n  gt()\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Filtered Volcano {.smaller}\n\n\n::: {.cell output-location='slide'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(\n  diff_lfc_sig,\n  aes(\n    x = log2FoldChange,\n    y = -log10(padj),\n    color = sig\n  )\n) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.2) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"DIV7 expression / DIV0 expression, log2\",\n    y = \"-log10(FDR)\"\n  ) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    values = c(\"black\", \"red\"),\n    labels = c(\"NS\", \"FDR < 0.01\"),\n    name = \"\"\n  ) +\n  theme_cowplot()\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Plotting the expression of single genes {.smaller}\n\nSometimes we will have particular marker genes that we might want to highlight to give confidence that the experiment worked as expected. We can plot the expression of these genes in each replicate. Let's plot the expression of two pluripotency genes (which we expect to decrease) and two neuronal genes (which we expect to increase).\n\nSo what is the value that we would plot? We could use the 'normalized counts' value provided by `DESeq2`. However, remember there is not length calculation so it is difficult to compare accross genes.\n\nA more interpretable value to plot might be TPM, since TPM is length-normalized.  Let's say a gene was expressed at 500 TPM. Right off the bat, I know generally what kind of expression that reflects (pretty high).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Get TPMs {.smaller}\nLet's plot the expression of Klf4, Sox2, Bdnf, and Dlg4 in our samples.\n\n\n::: {.cell output-location='slide'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntpms <- txi$abundance |>\n  as.data.frame() |>\n  rownames_to_column(var = \"ensembl_gene_id\") |>\n  inner_join(??) |> # add symbols\n  dplyr::rename(gene = external_gene_name) |>\n  # Filter for genes we are interested in\n  filter(gene %in% c(\"Klf4\", \"Sox2\", \"Bdnf\", \"Dlg4\"))  |>\n  pivot_longer(-c(ensembl_gene_id, gene)) |>\n  separate(col = name, into = c(\"condition\",\"rep\"), sep = \"\\\\.\")\n\ngt(tpms)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Now plot {.smaller}\n\n\n::: {.cell output-location='column-fragment'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(\n  tpms,\n  aes(\n    x = ??,\n    y = ??,\n    color = ??\n  )\n) +\n  geom_jitter(size = 2, width = .25) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"\",\n    y = \"TPM\"\n  ) +\n  theme_cowplot() +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"red\")) +\n  facet_wrap(~gene, scales = \"free_y\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## How about pathways? {.smaller}\n\nSay that instead of plotting individual genes we wanted to ask whether a whole class of genes are going up or down.  We can do that by retrieving all genes that belong to a particular gene ontology term.\n\nThere are three classes of genes we will look at here:\n\n - Maintenance of pluripotency (GO:0019827)\n - Positive regulation of the cell cycle (GO:0045787)\n - Neuronal differentitaion (GO:0030182)\n\n##  Retrieve pathway information {.smaller}\nWe can use `biomaRt` to get all genes that belong to each of these categories.  Think of it like doing a gene ontology enrichment analysis in reverse.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npluripotencygenes <- getBM(\n  attributes = c(\"ensembl_gene_id\"),\n  filters = c(\"go_parent_term\"),\n  values = c(\"GO:0019827\"),\n  mart = mart\n)\n\ncellcyclegenes <- getBM(\n  attributes = c(\"ensembl_gene_id\"),\n  filters = c(\"go_parent_term\"),\n  values = c(\"GO:0045787\"),\n  mart = mart\n)\n\nneurongenes <- getBM(\n  attributes = c(\"ensembl_gene_id\"),\n  filters = c(\"go_parent_term\"),\n  values = c(\"GO:0030182\"),\n  mart = mart\n)\n\n\n# pathway <- bind_rows(pluripotencygenes,\n#           cellcyclegenes,\n#           neurongenes\n#           )\n#\n# pathway$path <- c(\n#   rep(\"pluri\",nrow(pluripotencygenes)),\n#   rep(\"cellcycle\",nrow(cellcyclegenes)),\n#   rep(\"neuron\",nrow(neurongenes))\n#                   )\n#\n# write_csv(x = pathway, file = here(\"data\",\"block-rna\",\"pathwaygenes.csv.gz\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n##  Add pathway information to results {.smaller}\n\nYou can see that these items are one-column dataframes that have the column name 'ensembl_gene_id'.  We can now go through our results dataframe and add an annotation column that marks whether the gene is in any of these categories.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndiff_paths <-\n  diff_lfc |>\n  mutate(\n    annot = case_when(\n      ?? %in% pluripotencygenes$ensembl_gene_id ~ \"pluripotency\",\n      ?? %in% cellcyclegenes$ensembl_gene_id ~ \"cellcycle\",\n      ?? %in% neurongenes$ensembl_gene_id ~ \"neurondiff\",\n      .default = \"none\"\n    )\n  ) |>\n  drop_na() # drop na\n\n# Reorder these for plotting purposes\ndiff_paths$annot <-\n  factor(\n    diff_paths$annot,\n    levels = c(\"none\", \"cellcycle\",\n               \"pluripotency\", \"neurondiff\")\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Are there significant differences? {.smaller}\n\nOK we've got our table, now we are going to ask if the log2FoldChange values for the genes in each of these classes are different that what we would expect.  So what is the expected value?  Well, we have a distribution of log2 fold changes for all the genes that are **not** in any of these categories.  So we will ask if the distribution of log2 fold changes for each gene category is different than that null distribution.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npvals <- rstatix::wilcox_test(data = ??,\n                              ?? ~ ??, ref.group = \"none\")\n\n\np.pluripotency <- pvals |>\n  filter(group2 == \"pluripotency\") |>\n  pull(p.adj)\n\np.cellcycle <- pvals |>\n  filter(group2 == \"cellcycle\") |>\n  pull(p.adj)\n\n\np.neurondiff <- pvals |>\n  filter(group2 == \"neurondiff\") |>\n  pull(p.adj)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## plot pathway differences {.smaller}\n\n\n::: {.cell output-location='slide'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(\n  ??,\n  aes(\n    x = ??,\n    y = ??,\n    fill = ??\n  )\n) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Gene class\",\n    y = \"DIV7/DIV0, log2\"\n  ) +\n  geom_hline(\n    yintercept = 0,\n    color = \"gray\",\n    linetype = \"dashed\"\n  ) +\n  geom_boxplot(\n    notch = TRUE,\n    outlier.shape = NA\n  ) +\n  theme_cowplot() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"gray\", \"red\", \"blue\", \"purple\"), guide = F) +\n  scale_x_discrete(\n    labels = c(\n      \"none\", \"Cell cycle\", \"Pluripotency\", \"Neuron\\ndifferentiation\"\n    )\n  ) +\n  ylim(-5, 7) +\n  # hacky significance bars\n  annotate(\"segment\", x = 1, xend = 2, y = 4, yend = 4) +\n  annotate(\"segment\", x = 1, xend = 3, y = 5, yend = 5) +\n  annotate(\"segment\", x = 1, xend = 4, y = 6, yend = 6) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 1.5, y = 4.4, label = paste0(\"p = \", p.cellcycle)) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 2, y = 5.4, label = paste0(\"p = \", p.pluripotency)) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 2.5, y = 6.4, label = paste0(\"p = \", p.neurondiff))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## What if we want to look at pathways in an unbiased way? {.smaller}\n\nWe will use Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) to determine if pre-defined gene sets (pathways, GO terms, experimentally defined genes) are coordinately up-regulated or down-regulated between the two conditions you are comparing.
