Through careful field research measuring 1000 wild jackalopes, we have determined the mean height is 97 cm and the standard deviation is 10 cm. Your was camping and found a jackalope. Being a great friend and knowing your interest in jackalopes, they (harmlessly) subdued and measured the wild jackalope and found that it was 75 cm.\n\n1.  Simulate a normal distribution of `1000` jackalope heights using the `mean` and `sd` you painstakingly measured.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nj <- tibble(height = rnorm(n = 1000, mean = 97, sd = 10))\n```\n:::\n\n\n2.

This is not always the case for a single round of flipping, but if we do multiple rounds with (`numRounds`) that average should be 50%.\n\n## Problem \\# 2\n\nIn class, we simulated coin flip experiments using two different coins that were either fair (0.5 prob of head) or unfair (0.9 prob of head). We varied the number of flips in a single round (`numFlips`) and the number of rounds of flipping (`numRounds`). For this assignment, use the same to coins and use all possible combinations of `numFlips` and `numRounds` from the table below.\n\n| `numFlips` | `numRounds` |\n|------------|-------------|\n| 5          | 10          |\n| 500        | 100         |\n\n: parameters to explore\n\n1.
