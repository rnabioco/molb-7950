## Prepare

- Look over the [ggplot2 cheatsheet](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/data-visualization.pdf).

    We'll be using the basic ggplot2 structure with `ggplot()`, `aes()`, and various `geom_*()` functions like `geom_point()`, `geom_bar()`, and `geom_histogram()`. Pay special attention to the aesthetics section (color, size, shape) and the faceting functions `facet_wrap()` and `facet_grid()`.
