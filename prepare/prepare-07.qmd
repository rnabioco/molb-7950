## Prepare

- Look over the [dplyr cheatsheet](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/data-transformation.pdf) again. This time, look over the `*_join` functions.
- Also look throgh [these animations](https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/project/tidyexplain/) that visually explain the join transformations.
