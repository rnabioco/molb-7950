## Prepare

- Look at the `*_join()` functions in the [dplyr cheatsheet](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/data-transformation.pdf). [These animations](https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/project/tidyexplain/) are helpful visualizations of the join transformations.
- Look over the cheatsheets for [`stringr`](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/strings.pdf) and [`forcats`](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/factors.pdf).
- Look over the `scale_*()` functions (second page) in the [ggplot2 cheatsheet](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/data-visualization.pdf).
