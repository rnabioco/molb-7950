## Problem Set

Total points: 20. First problem is worth 7 points, second problem is worth 13 points.

## Load libraries

Start by loading libraries you need analysis in the code chunk below.

```{r}
#| label: load-libs
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(cowplot)
library(valr)
```

Load the data from the MNase-seq experiment.

```{r}
#| label: load-mnase-bed
mnase_tbl <- read_bed(
  here("data/block-dna/yeast_mnase_chrII.bed.gz")
)
```

In class we learned that MNase digestion yields nucleosomal "footprints" of \~150 bp in size. I've added blue vertical lines to emphasize positions of the major peak (intact nucleosomes) as well as smaller "sub-nucleosomal" peak.

We can calculate the counts for the histogram above and more precisely determine the maximum signal using `which.max()` to identify the *index* of the maximum value in a vector (*not* the value itself!):

```{r}
#| label: frag-hist
frag_hist <-
  mnase_tbl |>
  mutate(frag_len = end - start) |>
  count(frag_len)

# `which.max` takes a vector and gives us the index of the maximum value
max_idx <- which.max(frag_hist$n)

# now we can use index to find the abundant fragment size.
# we'll use `ncp_max` later in question 2.
ncp_max <- frag_hist$frag_len[max_idx]
```

So this tells us that that the most abundant fragment size in the library is ??? bp.

## Question 1 -- 7 points

Let's take a closer look at the some of the smaller fragments in the MNase experiment. In particular, let's zoom in on the populations of fragments that are smaller than 1 nucleosome in size, the peak between 85 and 95 bp (the left-most blue vertical line).

1.  Use the above strategy to precisely determine the peak of this smaller size range. How big are those fragments? These are called "sub-nucleosomal" fragments.

```{r}
#| label: frag-hist-sub
#| eval: false
# store the maximum value in `subnuc_max`. we'll use it later in question 2.
```

> The maximum sub-nucleosomal fragments size is ??? bp.

2.  Do this one more time, and identify the position of maximum signal in the disome peak (i.e., the fragments protected by two nucleosomes).

```{r}
#| label: frag-hist-disome
```

3.  Recreate the histogram using ggplot2 (using relevant code from class 17) and add the blue vertical lines at the peak positions you calculated, including the position of the disomes above.

```{r}
#| label: plot-frag-hist
```

## Question 2 -- 13 points

Next we're going to look at *where* these sub-sucleosomes are with respect to intact nucleosomes.

Our strategy will be to compare the density of sub-nucleosomes relative to the mid-points of previously mapped nucleosomes. Specifically, our reference point will be the midpoints of the +1 nucleosomes.

So you'll make a metaplot, but instead of using transcription start sites as the reference point, we'll use the midpoints of the +1 nucleosome, and instead of MNase-seq signal density, you'll count up the number of individual reads that intersect with windows around those midpoints.

1.  First, load the relevant data. We'll re-use the `yeast_mnase_chrII.bed.gz` data you loaded above, plus you'll need to load two other files:

    -   a "genome" file, `sacCer3.chrom.sizes`
    -   a BED file, `yeast_p1_chrII.bed.gz` which contains the mid-points of the +1 nucleosomes on chromosome 22. Recall that the +1 nucleosome is the nucleosome downstream of the transcription start site.

```{r}
#| tidy: false
#| label: load-data-2
genome <- read_???(here("data/block-dna/sacCer3.chrom.sizes"))
p1_tbl <- read_???(here("data/block-dna/yeast_p1_chrII.bed.gz"))
```

2.  Next, we need the mid-points of nucleosomes for comparison. The following function needs fixing. The midpoint is the coordinate halfway between the start and end of a given interval.

    You're going to provide the `mnase_tbl` defined in question 1 to this function, which then:

    -   calculates fragment lengths

    -   filters them based on `min_len` and `max_len`

    -    calculates the midpoints for each interval

        The output is a new tibble with columns `chrom`, `start`, and `end`.

```{r}
#| tidy: false
#| label: calc-midpoints
#| eval: false
calc_mids <- function(tbl, min_len, max_len) {
  tbl |>
    mutate(
      frag_len = ___ - ___
    ) |>
    filter(
      frag_len >= ___ & frag_len <= ___
    ) |>
    mutate(
      # calculate the half-size interval using `end` and `start,
      # then add that value to `start`
      midpoint = ___
    ) |>
    select(chrom, midpoint) |>
    rename(start = midpoint) |>
    mutate(end = start + 1)
}
```

3.  Next, use that function to calculate midpoints, and expand these midpoints by 20 bp in each direction with `bed_slop()`.

```{r}
#| tidy: false
#| label: nuc-mid-ivls
#| eval: false
ncp_mids_tbl <-
  # first calculate midpoints for nucleosome fragments within 3 bp length `ncp_max`
  calc_mids(mnase_tbl, ___ - 3, ___ + 3) |>
  # expand those windows to get a larter window for intersection
  bed_slop(genome, both = 20)

# now, do the same for nucleosome fragments of length `subnuc_max`
subnuc_mids_tbl <-
  calc_mids(mnase_tbl, ___ - 3, ___ + 3) |>
  bed_slop(genome, both = 20)
```

4.  Next, we need to make the reference points for a metaplot. We'll look 100 bp up- and downstream of the +1 nucleosome positions, and make windows that are 1 bp in size.

```{r}
#| tidy: false
#| label: p1-ivls
#| eval: false
p1_win_tbl <-
  bed_???(
    p1_tbl,
    genome,
    both = 100
  ) |>
  bed_???(win_size = 1)
```

5.  Almost there! Now you just need to identify the number of short and long nuclesome fragments (based on their midpoints) that intersect with the +1 nucleosomes you defined above.

    Use `bed_intersect()` to identify fragments that overlap, and then just count the number of fragments per `.win_id` (don't forget the suffix). Note you will do this separately for the short and long fragments.

```{r}
#| tidy: false
#| label: count-windows
#| eval: false
ncp_mids_summary_tbl <-
  bed_intersect(
    p1_win_tbl,
    ncp_mids_tbl
  ) |>
  dplyr::count(___) |>
  mutate(type = "Intact nucleosomes (~149 bp)")

subnuc_mids_summary_tbl <-
  bed_intersect(
    p1_win_tbl,
    subnuc_mids_tbl
  ) |>
  dplyr::count(___) |>
  mutate(type = "Sub-nucleosomes (~90 bp)")
```

6.  The following joins the tables you made together, and makes the x-axis more informative, by converting to relative genomic position rather than window ID.

```{r}
#| tidy: false
#| label: window-pos
#| eval: false
win_ids <- seq(-100, 100, 1)

all_tbl <- bind_rows(
  ncp_mids_summary_tbl,
  subnuc_mids_summary_tbl
) |>
  mutate(win_ids = win_ids, .by = "type")
```

7.  Finally, we plot the data with position on the x-axis, and count on the y-axis.

```{r}
#| tidy: false
#| label: plot-meta
#| eval: false
#| fig.alt: "Description of the plot - PLEASE FILL IN"
ggplot(
  all_tbl,
  aes(win_ids, n)
) +
  geom_???(color = "red") +
  facet_wrap(
    ~ type,
    scales = "free_y"
  ) +
  theme_minimal_grid() +
  labs(
    x = "Position relative to +1 nucleosome midpoints",
    y = "Number of intersecting fragments",
    title = "Fragment density around +1 nucleosome midpoints"
  )
```
