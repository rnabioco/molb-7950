## Extreme aRt --- Objective

Your objective is to create some new *extreme* art using R, something either ugly or sublime. What you *cannot* do is be boring; your goal is to stay on the fringe.

**Your submission (a Quarto .qmd file) is due Tues Sept 2 by 5pm**. If you submit an entry, you get full credit on the problem set. Entries will be anonymized and winners will selected by popular vote.

## Favorite Rtists

Here are some of my favorite generative artists who use R. Be inspired!

-   Danielle Navarro [[Art]](https://art.djnavarro.net/) [[Github]](https://github.com/djnavarro)
-   Ijeamaka Anyene [[Github]](https://github.com/Ijeamakaanyene) and [this study](https://ijeamakaanyene.github.io/patterns/zine/zine_radial_patterns.html#1) in particular.
-   Claus Wilke [[Art]](https://clauswilke.com/art/) [[Github]](https://github.com/clauswilke), a biologist at UT Austin who also wrote [the book on data visualization](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/) (it's excellent).
-   Thomas Lin Pederesen [[Art]](https://www.data-imaginist.com/art) [[Github](https://github.com/thomasp85)]. I have some of his pieces in my office.
-   inconvergent [[Art]](https://img.inconvergent.net/plot/) [[Github]](https://github.com/inconvergent/weird). It's lisp, not R. But it's so good.

There are several resources for color palettes, an important component of any hideous or beautiful creation.

-   The section in [Data Viz for R on color](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/color-basics.html) is worth a read.
-   The colors in e.g. `scale_color_brewer` come from [Cynthia Brewer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynthia_Brewer), a cartographer who makes [visually informative maps](https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=BuGn&n=3).
-   [color-hex](https://www.color-hex.com/color-palettes/) has collections of complementary color palettes.

There are also several R packages that might help you build Rtistic plots.

- [gganimate](https://gganimate.com/) provides tools to bring your plots to life.
- [ggforce](https://ggforce.data-imaginist.com/) provides interesting geoms that build on ggplot2.
- [patchwork](https://github.com/thomasp85/patchwork) provides layout functions for plots.

## Informative, but boring.

This is an informative but relatively boring plot. **NOT THE GOAL HERE.**

penguins_clean <- drop_na(penguins)

ggplot(
  penguins_clean,

    y = bill_length_mm

## Ugly Plots

Yikes. We can thank [Yunus Ozekin](https://twitter.com/yozekin) for this abomination.

```{r}

titanic_tbl <- as_tibble(Titanic)

ggplot(
  titanic_tbl,

    y = n,
    color = Class,
    shape = Sex,
    size = 6
  )
) +
  geom_jitter() +

    y = "How many? (ppl)",

  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(
      face = "bold.italic",
      color = "#993333",
      size = 18,
      angle = 180
    ),

    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 22, color = "pink", angle = 12),
    axis.title.y = element_text(color = "yellow", angle = 273, size = 17),
    legend.background = element_rect(fill = "yellow"),
    legend.title = element_text(
      angle = 71,
      face = "bold",
      color = "purple",
      size = 12
    ),
    legend.key = element_rect(color = "green", fill = "orange"),
    legend.text = element_text(color = "red", size = 14),
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "yellow"),
    panel.grid.major.y = element_line(
      color = "green",
      linetype = "dotdash",
      linewidth = 1.2
    ),
    panel.grid.major.x = element_line(
      color = "purple",
      linewidth = 3,
      linetype = "twodash"
    ),
    panel.grid.minor = element_line(
      color = "red",
      linewidth = 2,
      linetype = "dashed"
    ),
    legend.position = "bottom"
  )
```

## Beautiful Plots

This is a piece from Ijeamaka Anyene's ode to `coord_polar()` (link above). Reminds me of Miro.

```{r}
#| label: anyene
#| warning: false
#| fig.alt: "Description of the plot - PLEASE FILL IN"
library(tidyverse)

apply_pattern_theme <- function(bg_hex, caption_hex) {
  theme(
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = bg_hex),
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = bg_hex),
    panel.grid = element_blank(),
    plot.caption = element_text(
      family = "Open Sans",
      size = 6,
      color = caption_hex
    ),
    legend.position = "none",
    axis.title = element_blank(),
    axis.text = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks = element_blank()
  )
}

outline <- tibble(
  x = 1,
  xend = 7,
  y = 15,
  yend = 15
)
segment_line <- tibble(
  x = c(1, 7),
  xend = c(1, 7),
  y = c(0, 2),
  yend = 15
)
area <- tibble(
  x = c(3, 5, 6),
  y = c(5, 7.5, 2),
  type = LETTERS[1:3]
)
palette_values <- c("#2a2640", "#a64e46", "#f29544")
ggplot() +
  geom_col(
    data = area,
    aes(x = x, y = y, fill = type),
    alpha = 0.75,
    width = 4
  ) +
  geom_segment(
    data = outline,
    aes(
      x = x,
      y = y,
      xend = xend,
      yend = yend
    ),
    size = 0.5
  ) +
  geom_segment(
    data = segment_line,
    aes(
      x = x,
      xend = xend,
      y = y,
      yend = yend
    ),
    size = 0.5
  ) +
  geom_point(aes(x = 5, y = 0)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = palette_values) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 15)) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1, 10)) +
  coord_polar() +
  labs(caption = "Ijeamaka Anyene | @ijeamaka_a") +
  apply_pattern_theme(
    bg_hex = "#ded5c9",
    caption_hex = "black"
  )
```

Here's another more complex geometric creation, again using `coord_polar()`. This will take a few seconds to render.

```{r}
#| label: twitter
# https://twitter.com/aschinchon/status/1095057262744387587
library(tidyverse)

xy <- seq(-2, 2, by = .005)
expand.grid(x = xy, y = xy) |>
  ggplot(
    aes(
      x = (cos(x)^2 + sin(y^2)),
      y = (sin(y)^3 - cos(x^2))
    )
  ) +
  geom_point(alpha = .01, shape = 20, size = 0) +
  theme_void() +
  coord_polar()
```
