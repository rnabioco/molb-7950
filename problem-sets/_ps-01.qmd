## Problem Set

Each problem below is worth **10 points**.

**The problem set is due 12pm on Aug 30.**

### Grading rubric

-   Everything is good: 10 points
-   Partially correct answers: 6-8 points
-   Reasonable attempt: 4 points

## Setup

Start by loading libraries you need analysis in the code chunk below. When in doubt, start by loading the tidyverse package.

```{r}
```

## Question 1

Create 3 different vectors called `x`, `y`, and `z`:

-   `x` should be character vector of length 5
-   `y` should be a numerical vector of length 5
-   `z` should be a logical vector of length 5

Use `length()` to calculate the length of each vector.

```{r}
```

## Question 2

Using the vectors you created above, create a new tibble with column names `x`, `y`, and `z`.

Use `nrow()` and `ncol()` to calculate the number of rows and columns.

```{r}
```

What do you notice about the length of the vectors and the number of rows?
